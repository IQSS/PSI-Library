Descriptions of status of the different components of the library
Last updated: 9.12.19

Mechanisms:

1. Laplace: done
2. Gaussian: done
3. Stability: done, but only implemented for histogram
4. Exponential: not ready; problem with quality metric.
5. Objective: not ready; problem with loss function calculations
6. Bootstrapping: done in PR (broken in develop)

Statistics:

1. Mean: done except input validation (PRs are open for this)
2. Variance: done but need to merge in changes (PRs are open for this)
3. Histogram: done except input validation (PRs are open for this)
4. Covariance: in progress
5. Tree: in progress
6. GLM: dependent on fixing objective mech (Mike has possible fixes maybe?)
7. Heavyhitters: blocked until exponential mechanism fixed; also not clear about utility of the statistic.
